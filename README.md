Unity In Action 2nd Edition Notes

Great book on Unity from the author Joseph Hocking.

This repo is to track my Markdown notes related to code introduced in the book.

My notes are coming from the perspective of someone new to Unity and C#.

Manning gives the author the greatest cut from the book sale.

Good luck in your Game Development adventures. :)
